# üöÄ My Projects

Welcome to my **personal projects repository**!  
This repo contains a collection of my work in **Data Science, Machine Learning, Web Development, and Software Engineering**. Each folder represents a different project I‚Äôve worked on for **learning, practice, or real-world applications**.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- Each folder in this repo is a **standalone project**.  
- Inside each folder, you‚Äôll typically find:
  - üìú `README.md` (if provided) ‚Äì specific details about the project
  - üíª Source code /
    - [loan predection](./gradeuation_project.ipynb)
    - [leading-cause-of-death](./HTI_project(1).ipynb)
  - üìä Datasets

## üî• Featured Projects

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ [loan predection model](./gradeuation_project.ipynb)
**Description:** in this project I took a dataset about loans that has a details of customers that apply for loans and cleans the data and make some Exploratory Data Analysis plots then train some models and make a predict whether this loan application accepted or not ,At the end there a dashboard made using gradio.  
**Tech stack:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib ,seaborn
**Highlights:**
- collected and cleaned raw data
- implemented feature engineering and preprocessing
- visualized some important questions
- Trained ML models and evaluated performance:

| Model                   | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-score |
|-------------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression     | 0.91     | 0.99      | 0.90   | 0.94     |
| Random Forest           | 0.99     | 0.99      | 0.98   | 0.99     |
| XGBoost                 | 0.99     | 0.99      | 0.98   | 0.99     |
| KNN                     | 0.96     | 0.98      | 0.97   | 0.97     |
| SVM                     | 0.97     | 0.99      | 0.97   | 0.98     |

- Built a simple dashboard for insights

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ [leading-cause-of-death](./HTI_project(1).ipynb)
**Description:** In this project I took a dataset from kaggle about the cuases of death and death rate in US ,The applecation celan the dataset at first then training a model for predicting the death rate ,At the end there a dashboard made using gradio. 
**Tech stack:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib ,seaborn
**Highlights:**
- collected and cleaned raw data
- implemented feature engineering and preprocessing
- Trained ML models and evaluated performance:

| Model                   | RMSE     | MAE       | Test R2| Train R2 |
|-------------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Random Forest           | 0.079    | 0.052     | 0.996  | 0.999    |
| XGBoost                 | 0.079    | 0.057     | 0.996  | 0.998    |
| KNN                     | 0.242    | 0.166     | 0.963  | 0.979    |
| SVR                     |0.714     | 0.538     | 0.678  | 0.666    |
